"A wedding invitation builder that allows users to create their own personalized wedding invitations using a variety of pre-designed templates. Users can customize text, colors, images, and layout to match their wedding theme. I created this project to learn full-stack web development using React, Node.js, and JavaScript. Building this app helped me practice both front-end UI design and back-end functionality, including template rendering, user input handling, and data storage.",
